<h1>Tank cleaning guide</h1>
<div class=cleaning>
<h3>You will need: An algae scrubber, a tank siphon, lime cleaner, bleach, clean filter cartridge, and a aquarium brush</h3>
<h3>At first, this guide may seem complex or even scary, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy!</h3>
<li>First, prepare the tank for cleaning. Gather your supplies and have them nearby.</li>
<li>Next, get your betta and safely transport him/her to a bowl or temporary tank</li>
<li>Scrub the inside of the tank with the scrubber and get all off the algae spots</li>
<li>Soak the aquarium decorations in bleach for an hour. Make sure to get ALL of the bleach off before putting the decorations back in</li>
<li>Siphon away all of the dirty water from the gravel and dump it out</li>
<li>Use aquarium safe lime cleaner on the outside of the tank to clean the glass</li>
<li>Change the filter cartridge</li>
<li>Put your betta back in its home</li>
<li>You're done!</li>
