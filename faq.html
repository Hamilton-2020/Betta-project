<div class=faqs>
    <li>Q.Can Bettas live with other fish? 
        A. Absolutely! Just be careful when choosing because your betta can be aggresive if it's a male</li>
    <li>Q.How big does a bettas tank have to be? 
        A. Great question! The general rule is bigger is always better but if you are space 
        conscious I would recommend a 5 gallon at minimum</li>
    <li>Q.How long do bettas live? 
        A.Bettas can normally live anywhere from 2 to five years depending on how you care for them!</li>
    <li>Q.At what temperature does a bettas tank have to be? 
        A.For a happy betta, keep their tank at about 75-80 degrees farenheit</li>
    <li>Q.Can a betta live in tap water? A. No! You should always put in conditioner to prevent chlorine poisoning</li>
    <li>Q.What is that clump of bubbles my fish is making in his tank? 
        A.That is a bubble nest! Your betta is a male and it is a sign 
        that he is healthy and happy in his home. Males make this when they are old enough to breed to hold his eggs. </li>
    <li>Q.How do I know if my betta is happy? 
        A.Your fish will have bright, vibrant colors and swim around their tank a lot. He/she will have a big appetite and make a bubble 
        nest if its a male.</li>
