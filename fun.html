    <li>Did you know that bettas can survive out of water for a prolonged period of time? This is because they jump from rice paddy 
    to padddy in the wild. This is why you should ALWAYS have a lid on your tank. Your betta can jump out and possibly die</li>
    <li>Domestic bettas are more aggresive. After years of selective breeding, domestic bettas slowly became more aggresive</li>
    <li>Betta fighting is a sport. Like cockfighting, this game involves the males fighting to the death and is just as cruel as 
        you imagine</li>
    <li>Bettas can learn tricks! Just like dogs, bettas are fun and playful, and can be taught to swim through hoops, follow your 
finger, and even jump out of the water on command!</li>
